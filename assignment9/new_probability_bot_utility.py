"""
ProbabilityRandBot -- A bot that applies a very simple probabilistic strategy whenever it is our
turn to play the first card.

At each move in the first phase, the probability is calculated that the opponent has a card in his/her hand
which is in the same color as our options, but higher. This could be considered an easy win for
our opponent, and should be avoided. This means we want to play a card with the highest probability that
there is no higher card of the same color in the opponents hand.

In the second phase we simply play random
