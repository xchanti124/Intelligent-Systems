    "## Machine Learning Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Your name: Chantal Ariu\n",
    "\n",
    "Your VUnetID: car103\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not provide your name and VUnetID we will not accept your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this exercise you should be able to work with some basic Machine Learning concepts, and implement and evaluate a learning-based approach to playing Schnapsen. In this notebook we are going to create an adaptive bot. We will use the principle discussed in the machine learning lecture, but now in an agent setting. This comes down to using basic hill-climbing search, but learn the heuristic function rather than implementing it. This will require a few basic ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature vectors were discussed in the lecture. Didn't get it, or working ahead? See\n",
    "https://brilliant.org/wiki/feature-vector/\n",
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Vy47dbI708\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practicalities\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow this Notebook step-by-step. For this course it is necessary that you manipulate the python programmes we provide. You can do the exercises in any Programming Editor of your liking. Still, please fill in the questions in this notebook as usual. You can also run tournaments in it if you want, but running them in your editor or via the commandline seems much more convenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please use your studentID+Assignment6.ipynb as the name of the Notebook, and fill in the missing cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: unlike the courses dedicated to programming we will not evaluate the style of the programs. But we will, however, test your programs on other data that we provide, and your program should give the correct output to the test-data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "As was mentioned, the assignment is graded as pass/fail. To pass you need to have either a full working code or an explanation of what you tried and what didn't work for the tasks that you were unable to complete (you can use multi-line comments or a text cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initialising\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we have to install the schnapsen python package.\n",
    "Run the below code cell.\n",
    "After running the cell, you have the schnapsen Github repository cloned in your current directory.\n",
    "You can find the new directory created with the name `schnapsen`.\n",
    "The detailed installation instructions can be found in the [README.md](https://github.com/intelligent-systems-course/schnapsen) of the repo.\n"
