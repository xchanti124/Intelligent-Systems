    "Your name: Chantal Elena Ariu\n",

    "If you do not provide your name and VUnetID we will not accept your submission. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "At the end of this exercise you should be able to use the Schnapsen platform, run basic games between agents, and run tournaments in order to evaluate rational agents (also called bots). You should also be able to identify the working patterns of the MiniMiax algorithm in this platform and the improvements with Alpha/Beta pruning. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Follow the individual steps and explain the MiniMax algorithm\n",
    "2. Make small modifications of the code to see the effect on the search algorithms\n",
    "3. Make small adaptations to the algorithm to study the computational properties\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practicalities\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow this Notebook step-by-step. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you can do the exercises in any Programming Editor of your liking. But you do not have to. Feel free to simply write code in the Notebook. Please use your studentID+Assignment5.ipynb as the name of the Notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: unlike the courses dedicated to programming we will not evaluate the style of the programs. But we will, however, test your programs on other data that we provide, and your program should give the correct output to the test-data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "As was mentioned, the assignment is graded as pass/fail. To pass you need to have either a full working code or an explanation of what you tried and what didn't work for the tasks that you were unable to complete (you can use multi-line comments or a text cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initialising \n",

    "First, let us make sure the necessary packages are installed, and imported. Run the cell relevant for your operating system:"
