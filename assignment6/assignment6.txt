The output: "{A: False, B: True, C: True}
{A: True, B: True, C: True}
True" means that the algorithm found two models of the knowledge base and since it was able to find models in the first place
it prints true since a knowledge base is satisfiable if there is at least one model.


It means that A, C, and D need to always be true in the models, meaning that there are two possible models
since B can be either true or false but the rest have to be true.


I have taken the knowledge base and negated all of it and the output now shows that A, C, D are all false for any model
which is how we can show the entailment of A or C or D by refutation (by negating everything and sat solving after that).
