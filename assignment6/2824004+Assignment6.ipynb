    "## Logical Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Your name: Chantal Elena Ariu\n",
    "\n",
    "Your VUnetID: car103\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not provide your name and VUnetID we will not accept your submission. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "At the end of this exercise you should be able to work with logical agents on the Schnapsen platform\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Be able to apply a SAT solver to check for satisfiability and entailment (bots)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "In this worksheet we'll get to know Propositional Logic and RDF.\n",
    "We start building a knowledge graph based agent for playing Schnapsen. The idea is to represent the game and the game states fully in RDF and use queries and logical entailments for getting information.\n",
    "We are not implementing any game play strategy yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "First things first, let's deal with dependencies for using the kb bot, namely numpy and scipy. They should be installed fairly easily via \"pip install numpy\", \"pip install scipy\".\n",
    "Furthermore you need the packages rdflib and owlrl to work with knowledge graphs. These packages can also be installed by using \"pip install rdflib\" and \"pip install owlrl\".\n",
    "rdflib is a in memory database for RDF.\n",
    "owlrl is a reasoning library for RDF-S and OWL which uses rdflib.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practicalities\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow this Notebook step-by-step. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you can do the exercises in any Programming Editor of your liking. But you do not have to. Feel free to simply write code in the Notebook. Please use your studentID+Assignment6.ipynb as the name of the Notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: unlike the courses dedicated to programming we will not evaluate the style of the programs. But we will, however, test your programs on other data that we provide, and your program should give the correct output to the test-data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "As was mentioned, the assignment is graded as pass/fail. To pass you need to have either a full working code or an explanation of what you tried and what didn't work for the tasks that you were unable to complete (you can use multi-line comments or a text cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initialising \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let us make sure the necessary packages are installed, and imported. Run the following code:"
