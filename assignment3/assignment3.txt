The most apparent difference is the amount of nodes generated in DFS, BFS and Greedy Best First Search. DFS generated 11 nodes, 
BFS generated 69 nodes and Greedy Best First Search generated 7 nodes. This means that Greedy Best First Search generated the
least amount of nodes, meaning it checked less nodes until it found the goal state compared to BFS and DFS. This is due to 
Greedy Best First Search using heuristics which allows for an informed search to take place compared to the uninformed searches
happening in DFS and BFS.


Since A star search combines the use of heuristics with the cost of reaching the goal from the current node it is at,
A star search is less expensive and more optimal since it will always find the least expensive way to get to the goal state,
whereas Greedy Best First Search takes the first path to the goal it can find, which in turn, leads to an unoptimal solution.
This can also be seen by the fact that Greedy Best First Search only explored 6 paths until it stops whereas A star explored 
26 paths, which is also the reason for why A star was able to find a path with the cost of only 61 compared to the path cost
of 149 that the path generated through Greedy Best First search.
